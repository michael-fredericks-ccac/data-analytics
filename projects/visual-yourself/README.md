# How Certain Pre-Workout Activities Affect My Stregnth

***

## Project Summary
For this project, I aim to determine how different factors done before exericising can increase my stregnth & conditioning. I will specifically be looking at the number of pushups I can do in one sitting as a measure of stregnth & conditioning.

A few things to note:
* I am currently not on a regular exercise schedule.
* Over the course of this study, I will not be adding a regular exercise routine - I will only be measuring the number of pushups I can do at one time.
* I will attempt to do the set of push-ups at the same time everyday - around mid-day.

The factors I will be including as datapoints before each set of pushups include:
* How many hours of sleep the night before.
* What time I woke up - in hours past midnight.
* How many calories consumed since I've woke up. (Roughly calculated)
* Caffeine consumption - in mg. (Roughly calculated)
* Whether or not I did a warm-up before the pushups. (Cardio Warmup)
* Whether or not I've done any work that morning - in hours worked. (For my job)
* How many days in a row (before) I have done pushups.
* Total number of days I've done pushups before the current set of pushups.
* Time I am doing pushups - in hours past midnight.

I plan to record each of these factors for each sample of number of pushups done in one sitting. Once all data is collected, I aim to use regression analysis to determine the rank (descending) and coefficient each factor contributes to the number of pushups I am able to accomplish in one sitting.
